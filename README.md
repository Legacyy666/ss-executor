# SS Executor

My custom web-based Roblox Serverside Executor (require scripts only).

## How to Use
1. Go to the live site: https://github.com/Legacyy666/ss-executor
2. Paste require script in the box (e.g. require(YOUR_ID).Execute("print('test')"))
3. Hit Execute
4. For auto-check: Run the loader in client executor first.

Works in backdoored games only. For better: Use Vision-Web.

Downloads:
- loader.lua (simple require loader)
